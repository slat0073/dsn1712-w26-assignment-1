    Our Mission

    Design Thinking, Explained was created to make design principles and creative problem-solving accessible to everyone. We believe that understanding how designers think can help anyone become a better problem solver, whether you're working in technology, education, business, or any other field.

    Our goal is to break down complex ideas into clear, understandable concepts—without the jargon that often makes design feel exclusive or intimidating.

    About the Structure
    
    This website was built as an educational resource to demonstrate how HTML structures content on the web. Each page uses semantic HTML elements to organize information in a logical, accessible way. The focus is on clean structure and meaningful content rather than visual styling.
