  <p>Good design does not begin with answers—it begins with questions. Before designers create anything, they spend time understanding the problem they are trying to solve.</p>

  <p>Asking questions helps uncover assumptions. A design solution might seem obvious at first, but without research, it can miss the real issue entirely. Designers ask who the user is, what they need, and why the problem exists in the first place.</p>

  <p>Questions also guide better decisions. When designers understand the context surrounding a problem, they can prioritize what truly matters instead of adding unnecessary features or visuals.</p>

  <p>In many ways, design is about listening. By observing, researching, and asking thoughtful questions, designers create work that is meaningful, effective, and human-centered.</p>
